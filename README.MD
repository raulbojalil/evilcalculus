# Evil Calculus

Solve as many math operations as you can, 3 + 2, 6 - 7, 5 + 2, ... Simple enough right?

But wait, there's a catch, you must solve the 2nd, 3rd or the nth previous operation! Hone your memory, retention and concentration skills in this game based on the addictive Devilish Calculations from the Brain Age series. 

Just aim for the highscore!

This app was developed using Ionic 2 as a way to test the new features of the framework. You can use it as a sample project.
